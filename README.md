### An Analysis of Theater Campaigns
This data compares percentages of success, failure, and cancellation of campaigns for plays through categories of price ranges, as depicted in the line graph below.

Outcomes are determined through whether the amount of money pledged reaches the fundraising goal for the play campaigns, illustrated through time.

Based on the data, three conclusions are clear.
1. The most successful plays had a goal of less than $1000.
2. The most successful plays had launch dates around May, but no matter what month, the likelihood of success is greater than the likelihood of failure or cancellation.
3. The fundraising goals with ranges from $0 to $20,000 and from $30,000 to $40,000 were the most successful.
Limitations of the conclusions include the fact that the data utilized in analysis do not have comparable units, success is only based on fundraising rather than play popularity, and there is no data on what strategies different plays used to achieve success in their fundraising campaigns.
